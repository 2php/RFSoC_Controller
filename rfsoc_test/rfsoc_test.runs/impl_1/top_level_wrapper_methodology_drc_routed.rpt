TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_top_level_clk_wiz_0 and RFDAC0_CLK are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_top_level_clk_wiz_0 and RFDAC0_CLK are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware.
